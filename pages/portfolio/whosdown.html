	<h2>The Problem</h2>

		<h3>The Need for Who's Down</h3>
		<p>You’re sitting alone at home. It’s a Friday night. You know fun things are going on tonight, but you don’t feel like going through the effort of a) finding out who is free and b) agreeing on something to do. You wish you could see what your friends are already going to tonight and then decide who you wanted to join for the night. You might give up and wallow in your #FOMO, or you might use Who’s Down.</p>

		<h3>About the Project</h3>
		<p>Who’s Down lets you organize last minute get-togethers, activities, events, hangouts, or whatever you want to call anything that involves people getting together. Users can see which of their Facebook friends are going to what activity or invite their friends to a certain activity if it looks interesting. All necessary coordinating and communication can happen within the app.</p>
		<p>Your Friday night is saved.</p>

		<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>I performed all my research and design work for this project within a single day in April 2017. My clients wanted me to whip out a few designs for them (they even had the colors picked out that they wanted), but I took us back a few steps first to make sure we were building a solution that was solving a genuine problem of the user.</p>

	<h2>The Process</h2>

		<h3>Initial Research</h3>
		<p>Originally, the idea was to be able to get together with friends quickly or to connect with strangers in the area that wanted to go to the same events. Not a bad start, but that was focusing on the ‘What’ more than the ‘Why’. After speaking with several potential users, I discovered that most users currently try to make plans with friends when they are lonely or bored. The core emotions that led our users to make plans were loneliness and boredom, and those are the emotions we needed to design around.</p>

		<p>From there, it was easy to decide that it had to be ridiculously easy for users to join or plan an event. We also assumed if a user’s existing friends were already on the app, they’d be more likely to use and invest in the app up front (hence why the Facebook login is required).</p>

		<p>I chose fun, unusual colors to alleviate the users' boredom. I also recommended in the implementation that surprising and delightful interactions would be included. Designing those animations wasn't in the scope of my one-day design sprint, but they would contribute to the user's experience.</p>


		<h3>Wireframes</h3>
		<p>To iron out easy-to-fix errors, I drew the initial screens I would design that day on the whiteboard in the presence of the clients. This helped define and scope their idea even further.</p>

			<p class="img-label">Using a whiteboard to figure out the user flow and basic screens</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Features</h3>

		<h4>Newsfeed</h4>
		<p>Keeping in mind the 'Why' of the application, I had two goals with the newsfeed.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Details like the time, location, and description of an event are readily available</li>
			<li>Sharing events with friends is easy</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both of these elements were necessary to helping the user cure their loneliness and boredom. The user needed to be able to peruse events quickly and invite other friends. This is why from the newsfeed you can see the event title, the description, the time, the location, and the number of people going to each event (and a red notification is a Facebook friend is going). The Share icon is also available for every event.</p>

					<p class="img-label">The new newsfeed with toned down colors</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Event details</h4>
		<p>Originally, I had event details on a separate page. A user would click on an event from the newsfeed to view further details. Upon further consideration, I decided to make that information available from an expanded version of the newsfeed itself. Again, the purpose of the app was to make it as easy as possible for the user to cure his loneliness and find something to do with friends, so I should make the user flow towards that goal as quick and easy as possible.</p>

			<div class="img-combo divide">
				<div>
					<img class="no-shadow" src="../../assets/imgs/whosdown/old-detail.png" alt="old detail screen">
					<p class="img-label">The original detail screen showed event details, including which friends were going (Facebook friends are defined with a highlighted circle on the outside)</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Now, a user simply taps the event for the event details to expand within the newsfeed. The user can then see who's going, join the event, or go to the chat to check it out more.</p>

					<p class="img-label">The same information, but toned down and relocated buttons</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Create Event</h4>
		<p>A natural extension of joining events quickly is creating events quickly. The '+' button on the bottom right is easy accessible from the newsfeed, so it's a simple 3-step process to create a new event. Tap the '+' button, enter the details of the event and invite friends, and submit.</p>

					<p class="img-label">The create screen with original design colors</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Chat</h4>
		<p>Communication is fundamental to creating and following through with plans. Naturally, this meant a chat feature should be included within Who's Down to facilitate each user's plans. For each event created, we would include a chat function so that all involved, whether they were Facebook friends or not, could communicate and coordinate with each other.</p>

	<h2>The Solution</h2>

		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/whosdown/wd-blue.png" alt="who's down blue marketing">
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Users sign in to Who's Down using Facebook and immediately see the newsfeed. They can search for events or simply browse for something that looks interesting. The most important details of each event can be seen from the newsfeed, so users can determine if they could or want to go to the event. They can also see whether any of their friends are already going. If they want to see which friends, they simply tap to see the names of those going. Once a user picks an event, they can use the chat to talk to friends and strangers alike going to the event.</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<p>If nothing strikes their fancy, it's easy to create a new invite and see who's down.</p>
		<p>Who's Down is still currently in development, and is expected to be deployed within the next month.</p>
		<p>I've learned a lot since I created these designs, and I would do things very differently now. In fact, I <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@aliciadwilkin/rapid-prototyping-for-a-spontaneous-product-5318be822aac">wrote a Medium story about it</a> - check it out to learn how I'd apply design iterations and user feedback to validate my designs.</p>
