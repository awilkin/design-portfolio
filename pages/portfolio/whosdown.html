WHO+DOWN


Showing a screenshot of your work only tells me the “what”—it doesn’t tell me the “why.” Great UI design is a journey that’s all about finding a solution to a problem. The best UI design portfolios explain how you came upon this design and why it’s the best solution to the problems you’ve identified.


State the problem. What problem were you trying to solve? Stating this clearly at the beginning of your work lets the reader know that you weren’t just designing for design’s sake.

Show your wireframes. As a potential employer, I want to see that you came to a solid solution on paper (or in your wireframing app of choice) before you started pushing pixels around.

Show your process. Every piece in your portfolio should be a journey. Take the viewer from start to finish, showing them how your thinking evolved and how you iterated over the design. Try to explain your thinking at each stage of the design process.
