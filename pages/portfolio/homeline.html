	<h2>The Problem</h2>

		<h3>The Need for Homeline</h3>
		<p>Anyone who has undertaken a remodeling project knows that communicating with contractors and tracking the progress of a project is a headache. Miscommunications, phone tag with your contractor, and vague and frustrating bills from your contractor are all pieces of the unpleasant experience.</p>

		<h3>About the Project</h3>
		<p>Homeline allows contractors and customers alike to track the progress, budget, and details of a remodeling venture. With this simple web app designed and built within a day, homes can be rebuilt, line by line.</p>

		<div class="img-combo">

		</div>

		<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>I was the product designer over a team of ten during the day-long design and development sprint in March 2017. From 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., I was responsible for defining the client's ideas as I rapidly prototyped the screens in Sketch. The screens I built in Sketch were developed by other members of my team as I designed them. The setup was highly efficient and inflexible to extreme change, so it was important to design well the first time.</p>

				<p class="img-label">A few developers of Homeline</p>
			</div>
		</div>

	<h2>The Process</h2>

		<h3>Idea Refinement</h3>
		<p>I worked side-by-side with the client to understand her vision. She'd recently been through a remodeling fiasco, so in this case, she was also a user. I could conduct small user interviews and usability testing throughout the day as I was building screens.</p>

		<h3>Wireframes</h3>
		<p>The entire team met and used a whiteboard to define the fundamental functions necessary to solve the user's problem. Keeping in mind that we only had 9 hours to build and deploy our app, we kept things as simple as possible.</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>Features</h3>

		<h4>Remodeling Project Summary</h4>
		<p>After speaking with the client, it became clear that in order to solve communication problems between the contractor and the remodeling client, both parties needed to see the budget, the schedule, and the tasks of the remodeling project. These three pieces of information are vital to both parties and cause the most contention. By making this information transparent and readily available from a project summary page, both parties could foresee problems and solve them early on.</p>

		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/p-detail.png" alt="project summary page">
				<p class="img-label">It's easy to see the budget for the project, who to contact, what tasks are happening that day all from the project detail page</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Budget</h4>
		<p>I chose to let contractors and clients see the budget in two ways. First in a quick summary view, and second in an analysis-friendly view where either party can get down to the granular details and compare the bid of a project versus what was actually spent. This way everyone involved knows where the charges are coming from and communication between parties can be more direct and efficient.</p>

		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/budget_breakdown.png" alt="allocated amounts per project">
				<p class="img-label">See the allocated amounts for each sub-project under a larger element of the project</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/task_breakdown.png" alt="task breakdown">
				<p class="img-label">See the tasks associated with the cost of a sub-project</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/full_budget_breakdown.png" alt="budget granular breakdown ">
				<p class="img-label">The drill-down version of the budget, where it's easy to see what the bid was and what the contractor is actually paying for it. Are you on track?</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h4>Scheduled Tasks</h4>
		<p>Another source of confusion between clients and contractors is knowing what work is being currently being done, and what needs to happen next. Contractors managing several projects need to see what tasks need to be completed today, so I created the view below where they can see all their current projects with notifications for projects that require action. To make it even easier, there's another list at the bottom that shows all Scheduled Tasks for the day.</p>

		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/contract-p-dropdown.png" alt="contracts summary for contractor">
				<p class="img-label">Contractor can see projects currently in progress and if any of them require immediate action</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>But what if the contractor realizes they forgot a vital task? No problem, they can add it into the project and get approval from the client to proceed, all from within Homeline.</p>

		<div class="img-combo">
			<div>
				<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/add_request.png" alt="add task to tasks">
				<p class="img-label">All required tasks for a certain portion of the project can be viewed, and new tasks can be added</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<h2>The Solution</h2>
		<p>By the end of the day, we had a fully functioning app that could help contractors and remodeling clients communicate with each other and be on the same page. Both parties could see the budget, the tasks for the day, and could easily communicate with each other. Homeline was fully developed in a single day and handed off to the client at the end of the day.</p>

			<div class="img-combo">
				<div>
					<img src="../../assets/imgs/homeline/ipad-iphone-mockup.png" alt="homeline pretty screens">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>If I could restart, I would include a contractor in the research portion of the process. We received plenty of input from one potential user of the app but in order for the application to succeed contractors would also need to invest in using Homeline. Using Homeline would be a large investment of time for contractors. Having a contractor present during the rapid prototyping would likely improve the ease of data input for the application as well. </p>
