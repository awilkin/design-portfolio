# Homeline

Build your home, line by line

## The Problem

### The Need for Homeline
Anyone who has undertaken a remodeling project knows that communicating with contractors and tracking the progress of a project is a headache. Miscommunications, phone tag with your contractor, and vague and frustrating bills from your contractor are all pieces of the unpleasant experience.

### About the Project
Homeline allows contractors and customers alike to track the progress, budget, and details of a remodeling venture. With this simple web app designed and built within a day, homes can be rebuilt, line by line.

### My Role
I was the product designer over a team of ten during the day-long design and development sprint in March 2017. From 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., I was responsible for defining the client's ideas as I rapidly prototyped the screens in Sketch. The screens I built in Sketch were developed by other members of my team as I designed them. The setup was highly efficient and inflexible to extreme change, so it was important to design well the first time.

## The Process

### Initial Research
I worked side-by-side with the client to understand her vision. She'd recently been through a remodeling fiasco, so in this case, she was also a user. I could conduct small user interviews and usability testing throughout the day as I was building screens.

### Wireframes
The entire team met and used a whiteboard to define the fundamental functions necessary to solve the user's problem. Keeping in mind that we only had 9 hours to build and deploy our app, we kept things as simple as possible.

### Features

#### Project Summary
After speaking with the client, it became clear that in order to solve communication problems between the contractor and the remodeling client, both parties needed to see the budget, the schedule, and the tasks of the remodeling project. These three pieces of information are vital to both parties and cause the most contention. By making this information transparent and readily available from a project summary page, both parties could foresee problems and solve them early on.

#### Budget
I chose to let contractors and clients see the budget in two ways. First in a quick summary view, and second in an analysis-friendly view where either party can get down to the granular details and compare the bid of a project versus what was actually spent. This way everyone involved knows where the charges are coming from and communication between parties can be more direct and efficient.

#### Scheduled Tasks
Another source of confusion between clients and contractors is knowing what work is being currently being done, and what needs to happen next. Contractors managing several projects need to see what tasks need to be completed today, so I created the view below where they can see all their current projects with notifications for projects that require action. To make it even easier, there's another list at the bottom that shows all Scheduled Tasks for the day.

But what if the contractor realizes they forgot a vital task? No problem, they can add it into the project and get approval from the client to proceed, all from within Homeline.

## The Solution

By the end of the day, we had a fully functioning app that could help contractors and remodeling clients communicate with each other and be on the same page. Both parties could see the budget, the tasks for the day, and could easily communicate with each other. Homeline was fully developed in a single day and handed off to the client at the end of the day.

If I could restart, I would include a contractor in the research portion of the process. We received plenty of input from one potential user of the app but in order for the application to succeed contractors would also need to invest in using Homeline. Using Homeline would be a large investment of time for contractors. Having a contractor present during the rapid prototyping would likely improve the ease of data input for the application as well.
