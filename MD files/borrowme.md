# BorrowMe

Creating a borrowing community.

## The Problem

### The Need for BorrowMe
We all have items we'd prefer to borrow rather than buy, and items we'd be willing to let others use for a while. But how do you find people nearby willing to share, or those who'd want to borrow your stuff? Even if you do find them, how do you create a community of trust so that strangers are willing to share with each other? Introducing BorrowMe. BorrowMe is intended to create a community of borrowing, especially in college town communities.

### My Role
I was the third person to join BorrowMe in June 2016. I was responsible for the experience strategy and design of the iOS app. I lead the UX work, producing all major deliverables and presenting these to the founders and users. I led and encouraged concept refinement.

## The Process

### Idea Refinement
In the preliminary stages, we started by going over the basics of their idea over Skype. I knew this — the part where I got inside their head and helped them round out their ideas— was one of the most important stages of the entire design process. I needed to nail down their fundamental requirements, and then analyze with them whether their requirements were realistic and fully fleshed out.

I was brought in right as they were building their database and backend, so I was able to help them adjust their structure to include necessary user information and to help them prepare for expansion. For insurance and analytics, what information would they want to gather from the user? How would they gather that information? What did they want to emphasize in the user’s experience? Also, as far as scope, did they want users to be able to borrow AND lend items? How would the users interact with each other? Through countless questions throughout this entire process, their idea was refined.

### Wireframes
After getting a feel for fundamental requirements, I whiteboarded options of what the main screens could look like. I started with navigation, and one or two user flows.

After receiving approval and tweaking my designs based on user feedback, I built a basic user login flow in Sketch. I chose the theme, font, and colors, knowing it was all subject to change. I wanted the app to feel lighthearted so users would be put at ease and be less worried about communicating and sharing with strangers, so I chose bright, fun colors. The users and founders alike approved of the colors, so they stayed.

After conducting several user tests, two necessary pieces of the user's first exposure to the app became clear:
- Don’t try to make them share anything before they trust the app
- Don’t make them feel isolated, especially if they’re one of the first adopters
The last point was vital because the success of BorrowMe depended on there being enough people willing to lend items to supply the borrowing demand. If a user can see she's the only one with BorrowMe within 50 miles, she would be far less likely to feel like part of a community and would likely stop using the app. Originally I'd planned on including a map showing other BorrowMe users, but decided not to include it until there was an established user base.

I adjusted the screens accordingly and continued the same process for the next month or so. I’d develop a few more screens in Sketch and send to the founders for feedback. I tested my designs on friends and other strangers on the train to and from work. I'd have them click through my prototype (built with Sketch Mirror and later InVision). I made note of their thoughts, behaviors, and struggles. The founders and I would discuss what they liked/didn’t like/hated, what would be best for users, and what was necessary for the MVP.

### Design Iterations

#### Profile
User profiles went through several design iterations. I tested several different options with users.

After analyzing the pros and cons of each screen and gathering data from testers, we decided keeping things simpler at first was a good start. When viewing another user's profile, there would be a single drop down with all the details. When viewing your personal account, you would see the third screen from above so you could have quick, compartmentalized access to your profile.

#### Email Verification
I used the iteration process to improve the email verification process. Originally the app would send an email to a user's account. The user would login to their email, click the verification link, navigate back to BorrowMe, and continue with the account creation process. This is a typical interaction between apps and users, but there are better ways. To make things a little easier, I instead gave them the option of having a verification code emailed or texted to them, which they’d then enter in to continue. Test users approved of the change.

#### Introduction Sequence
The final burst of work I did for BorrowMe was designing an walkthrough showing a user how to use the app.  Originally I’d planned on the introduction being just three or four screens &mdash; I believe brevity usually trumps effusion. However, I found while testing the app on users that most struggled to fully identify all the basic functions of the app. I didn’t necessarily agree with the feedback, but I wasn’t the end user, and sometimes a designer needs to [check their ego and accept that changes need to be made](blog.invisionapp.com/what-is-user-research/).

I rounded out explanations and added a full explanation of features. I ended up with 10 more screens than I’d started with. My personal preference still leans toward fewer screens, but further testing has validated that users need the longer walkthrough.

The need for a detailed and lengthy introduction also points to a different problem. The user may need further explanations because navigation isn't intuitive enough. A navigation redesign is on the list of future improvements for the application.


## The Solution
BorrowMe allows a user to choose the distance they would like to borrow or lend within. They can search for specific items to borrow, or peruse item categories. Coordinating drop-off and pick-up is possible through the app's chat feature.

One fundamental critique I have for my work is how we'd incentivize users to lend items. Plenty of research into insurance was conducted by the founders, but very little research was spent on understanding what would motivate users to risk sharing their valuables with others. We made the assumption that users would trust others on the app, but that is an entirely unvalidated assumption. If I were to start this project over, I would explore user motivations more.

BorrowMe is still in development.
